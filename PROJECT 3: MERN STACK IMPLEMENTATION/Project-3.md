## This project requires implementing a web solution based on MERN stack in the AWS Cloud.
A MERN Web stack consists of following components:

MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents. <br/>
ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js. <br/>
ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components. <br/>
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser. <br/>
